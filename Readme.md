# ELEVATOR SIMULATION

In this little project we are gonna try to emulate the life of an elevator.\
The main idea is that it can be really interesting to model the building behavior (in the sense of the people living in the buiding) in order to track and understand the probability distribution of the position of the elevator over time time (the position is indexed by the floor's number).

## Literature folder

I also added some interesting paper that aims to work with elevators. I found them nice and usefull for future innovations.
